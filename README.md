## Challenge #2 - The beautiful (data) game
Sports might or might not be your thing, but sports data is so very interesting. Let's try making something beautiful using data from the Swedish top soccer league! Like Zlatan on the pitch, you’ll need to adjust your moves to meet the challenge. This month’s design constraint is about keeping it small. How creative can you get if you have to make your visualisation fit to 345 x 345 pixels?

The data was collected from Swedish wikipedia pages on Allsvenskan, the top soccer league in Sweden.

__Design constraints:__ Keep the design small, 345px x 345px is the limit.

__Deadline:__ Monday March 15th 2021

## Challenge #1 - Snow and fire
This challenge is all about snow and heat. The dataset is about the snow depth and temperature in Stockholm and is quite large as it stretches from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century. You can choose to visualise the whole dataset or just parts of it, it is up to you.

The data was collected at a weather station in central Stockholm (Latitud 59.3417, Longitud 18.0549).

__Design constraints:__ Keep the design to black and white.

__Dataset:__ https://github.com/Dataviz-Stockholm/challenges/blob/main/date_temperature_snow.csv

__Deadline:__ Tuesday January 26th 2021
