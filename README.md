## Challenge #1 - Snow and fire
This challenge is all about snow and heat. The dataset is about the snow depth and temperature in Stockholm and is quite large as it stretches from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century. You can choose to visualise the whole dataset or just parts of it, it is up to you.

The data was collected at a weather station in central Stockholm (Latitud 59.3417, Longitud 18.0549).
